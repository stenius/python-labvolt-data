This library is used for reading the proprietary TBL files that are generated
by the Lab Volt software used in my Fundamentals of Power Engineering class at
Lamar University.

It can be used as a stand alone program for printing or as a library that has functions to
return a 2-D python list containing the table.

Examples:
to print to STDIO with column titles from lab_1.tbl run,
python openTbl.py -ti lab_1.tbl
[pauls@aqm ~/labVolt]$ python openTbl.py -ti lab_1.tbl
